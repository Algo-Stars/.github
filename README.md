## Getting Started

To get started with Algo Stars, make sure you have a GitHub account. If you don't have one, you can [create one here](https://github.com/join).

## Repository Structure

### Programming Language Repositories

We have separate repositories for different programming languages, each containing three subdirectories: `basic`, `intermediate`, and `advanced`. Within each of these subdirectories, you'll find weekly problem statements in the form of `.txt` files.

**Example:**
- **Repository:** `Algo-Stars/Python`
  - **Subdirectories:**
    - `basic/`
    - `intermediate/`
    - `advanced/`
  - **Problem Statement:** `basic/week1/problem_statement.txt`

### Project Repository

Apart from language-specific repositories, there's a project repository containing challenges and projects that span multiple programming languages.

## How to Contribute

Contributing to Algo Stars is straightforward. Follow the steps below:

### Forking the Repository

1. Navigate to the repository you want to contribute to (e.g., `Algo-Stars/Python`).
2. Click on the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the page.
   - This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

### Cloning the Forked Repository

1. On your forked repository, click on the "Code" button, and copy the URL.
2. Open your terminal and run the following command, replacing `<your-username>` with your GitHub username:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Python.git
   ```

### Making Changes

1. Navigate to the problem statement directory (e.g., `basic/week1/`).
2. Solve the problem using the online program editor linked in the README.
3. Save your solution in a file named `<your-username>.<programming-language-extension>`.

### Pushing Changes

1. In the terminal, navigate to your cloned repository:

   ```bash
   cd Python
   ```

2. Add your changes and commit:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Solved basic week 1 problem"
   ```

3. Push the changes to your GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### Creating a Pull Request

1. Visit your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the "Pull Requests" tab.
3. Click the "New Pull Request" button.
4. Set the base repository to `Algo-Stars/Python` and the base branch to `main`.
5. Set the head repository to `<your-username>/Python` and the compare branch to `main`.
6. Click the "Create Pull Request" button.
7. Add a title and description, then click "Create Pull Request" again.

Congratulations! You've just contributed to Algo Stars!!!
