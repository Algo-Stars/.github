# Code of Conduct

At Algo Stars, we believe in fostering a welcoming and inclusive community for all contributors. To ensure a positive and constructive environment, we ask that everyone follows our Code of Conduct.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- **Respectful Communication:** Be kind and considerate in all interactions. Avoid personal attacks, trolling, and harassment.
- **Inclusivity:** Welcome individuals of all backgrounds and levels of experience. Encourage diverse perspectives and opinions.
- **Collaboration:** Work together effectively, respecting each other's contributions and ideas.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- **Harassment:** Any form of harassment, be it verbal, written, or other, is not tolerated.
- **Discrimination:** Discrimination based on age, disability, ethnicity, gender, nationality, race, religion, or sexual orientation is not acceptable.
- **Disruptive Behavior:** Any disruptive behavior that interferes with the positive atmosphere of the community is not allowed.

## Reporting Violations

If you experience or witness behavior that violates our Code of Conduct, please report it by contacting the project team at [contact@algostars.org]. All reports will be kept confidential. The project team will review and investigate the issue and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may result in a warning or expulsion from the project and community. The project team has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.
